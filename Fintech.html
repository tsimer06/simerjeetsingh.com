This involved working closely with cross-functional teams, including IT, compliance, and risk management, to ensure that the technical solutions not only addressed the business needs but also met stringent compliance and regulatory guidelines.I facilitated workshops and interviews with stakeholders, translating their inputs into clear technical specifications and functional documentation. I was also actively involved in the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase, ensuring that all changes were thoroughly tested, validated, and met the defined business objectives.My contributions helped streamline the banking processes, improve operational efficiency, and ensure the platform remained compliant with evolving regulations.
