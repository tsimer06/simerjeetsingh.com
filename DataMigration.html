                    <b>Migration Requirements Gathering and Data Mapping</b><br>I collaborate closely with stakeholders to gather detailed migration requirements, analyzing the legacy data structure and ensuring compatibility with Oracle’s data model. This analysis allows us to identify necessary data transformations and ensure seamless data integration. I then document the migration requirements and conduct thorough data mapping, aligning legacy fields with Oracle Cloud Fusion to establish clear data connections and ensure consistency.<br>

I then document the migration requirements and conduct thorough data mapping, aligning legacy fields with Oracle Cloud Fusion to establish clear data connections and ensure consistency.<br>
                    <b>ETL Process and Data Integrity</b><br>Leveraging Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tools, I oversee the entire data extraction, transformation, and loading process, ensuring data accuracy and integrity. I define data validation and cleansing protocols to proactively address data quality issues, maintaining a high standard of data integrity throughout the migration.<br>
                    <b>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Issue Resolution</b><br>I facilitate User Acceptance Testing (UAT) sessions to validate that the migrated data meets business requirements and tracks any issues for resolution. I work closely with stakeholders to ensure that all business needs are met and provide regular project updates to align project milestones with stakeholder expectations.<br>
                    <b>Compliance, Security, and Governance</b><br>I ensure the data migration process adheres to strict security and governance standards, addressing compliance requirements to safeguard sensitive information. This is a critical part of the migration process to ensure the integrity and security of data.<br>
                    <b>Post-Migration Validation and User Training</b><br>I conduct final validation to confirm data integrity and perform post-migration testing to ensure smooth system operations. I also deliver training sessions to end users, ensuring they are equipped to manage data effectively in the new Oracle Cloud Fusion system. Additionally, I create detailed documentation to support ongoing system management and user understanding.<br>
                    <b>Results and Impact</b><br>The migration project resulted in a seamless transition to Oracle Cloud Fusion, with successfully mapped data, improved system performance, and enhanced data governance. The final solution was aligned with business goals and provided end-users with the tools and knowledge to effectively manage data in the new system.
