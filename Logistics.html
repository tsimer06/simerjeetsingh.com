                    <b>Logistics Management System</b><br>I optimized the Logistics Management System (LMS) for a major logistics company facing inefficiencies in shipment tracking, fleet management, and delivery scheduling, which contributed to higher operational costs and customer dissatisfaction.
                    <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1" class="more">I collaborated with logistics coordinators, fleet managers, and IT teams to gather requirements and define business needs for system improvements. Conducting a comprehensive gap analysis, I compared current LMS functionalities with industry best practices, identifying areas for enhancement such as real-time shipment tracking, fleet route optimization, and automated delivery notifications. I worked with the operations team to redesign logistics workflows, including automated route scheduling and better load management, to minimize delivery delays. Engaging stakeholders at all levels ensured alignment on project goals and necessary changes. I also led the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase to validate that the enhanced LMS functionalities met all stakeholder requirements. As a result, the project achieved a 20% increase in delivery efficiency, a 12% reduction in fuel costs, and improved fleet utilization, significantly enhancing customer satisfaction and streamlining operations.</span>

I managed external software vendors to ensure seamless system integration and utilized Agile methodology to deliver iterative improvements across multiple sprints. I coordinated system testing, including stress tests, and oversaw the phased rollout of the new platform. As a result, the project achieved a 30% reduction in order processing time, improved on-time deliveries by 20%, and provided clients with real-time shipment tracking visibility.</span>
