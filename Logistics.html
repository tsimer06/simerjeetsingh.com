                    <b>Requirement Gathering and Stakeholder Collaboration</b><br>To address the core challenges, I worked closely with logistics coordinators, fleet managers, and IT teams. I conducted thorough requirement-gathering sessions to define business needs for the LMS enhancements and engaged stakeholders across various departments to ensure alignment on project goals and objectives.<br>

                        <b>Gap Analysis and Process Improvement</b><br>Through an in-depth gap analysis, I benchmarked the existing LMS functionalities against industry standards, identifying critical improvement areas such as real-time shipment tracking, optimized fleet routing, and automated delivery notifications. I collaborated with the operations team to redesign logistics workflows, including automated route scheduling and load management, which directly minimized delivery delays.<br>
                        <b>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</b><br>Led the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase, I validated that the newly implemented LMS features met all stakeholder requirements and achieved targeted performance standards. This phase was essential for ensuring a smooth transition to the enhanced system.<br>
                        <b>RResults and Impact</b><br>The project yielded a 20% increase in delivery efficiency, a 12% reduction in fuel costs, and improved fleet utilization. These enhancements significantly boosted customer satisfaction while streamlining the company's logistics operations, reinforcing its position as a cost-effective and customer-centric service provider.

                    <b>Requirements Gathering and Process Mapping</b><br>Facilitating workshops with sales, operations, and IT teams, I defined integration requirements and established key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success. I mapped the existing logistics processes to identify inefficiencies and created detailed functional and non-functional requirement specifications, laying a strong foundation for the integration.

                        <b>Vendor Coordination and Agile Delivery</b><br>I managed external software vendors, ensuring alignment with integration goals and smooth collaboration throughout the project. Leveraging Agile methodology, I coordinated iterative development across multiple sprints, providing ongoing improvements and stakeholder feedback incorporation.<br>
                        <b>System Testing and Phased Rollout</b><br>To ensure system stability, I coordinated extensive testing, including stress testing and scenario-based validation. I oversaw the phased rollout of the new platform, ensuring a seamless transition and minimal disruption to ongoing operations.<br>
                        <b>Results and Impact</b><br>The project successfully reduced order processing time by 30%, improved on-time deliveries by 20%, and enabled clients to gain real-time visibility into shipment tracking. These improvements significantly elevated operational efficiency and enhanced customer satisfaction, strengthening the providerâ€™s competitive edge.
